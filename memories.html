Ruby and I met online. All of our correspondence thus far has been on WhatsApp, Facebook, and SMS.<br>
This is a compilation of some of those social media moments we had. Some are selected by her and others<br>
by me. I would have liked to include more but I lost most of our chats thanks to the unreliability of WhatsApp.<br> 
I wonder if we should all just switch to Telegram.....but that's a story for another day.<br><br><br>
